# llm-bench

Local LLM benchmark suite for picking an **agentic fleet** on a single GPU. It measures
each model on document comprehension, coding/tool-use, speed, context length and VRAM
footprint, then ranks them by a **capability** score and a **fleet-suitability** score,
and renders an interactive **Observable Framework** dashboard.

- **Orchestrator** — `runners/bench-run.mjs` (Node): the model × think × bench matrix loop.
  Runs **on the benchmarking host** from a git checkout (see §4); the dev box is only for
  editing. Bench modules live in `benches/` (reuse the graders in `benchmarks/*`);
  performance/capacity **probes** (`benches/probes/`) self-manage the server.
- **Inference** — two engines, selected per host by `engine:` in `config/hosts.yaml`:
  a `llama.cpp` server on a GPU host (`engine: llamacpp`, default; lifecycle/VRAM/health/
  systemd-router in `runners/llamacpp-server.mjs` + `scripts/llm2/`), or a **RapidMLX**
  daemon on Apple Silicon (`engine: rapidmlx`; persistent daemon launched by
  `scripts/llm1/serve.sh`, no-op lifecycle + no VRAM readout in `runners/rapidmlx-server.mjs`).
- **Store** — a **central Postgres** table, `llmbench.measurements` (central-db @
  192.168.1.120), one row per measured metric with every config axis (chat_template, kv_quant,
  quant, arch, finetune, llamacpp_build, sampling, think…) as a queryable column. `bench-run`
  writes rows here directly (`analysis/pg-store.mjs` `insertRows`); there is no Parquet file
  and no sync step — Postgres is the single source of truth. Access needs `LLMBENCH_DB_PASSWORD`
  (auto-loaded from a gitignored `.env`; see `.env.example`). Expensive facts (context ceilings,
  KV footprint) are still memoized in `results/caps/capabilities.json`, keyed by (gguf, quant,
  kv, backend, gpu, **llamacpp_build**) so a llama.cpp upgrade invalidates them.
- **Analysis** — `analysis/`: `score.mjs` (+ `scoring-config.mjs`) computes capability/fleet
  over any filtered slice; `query-engine.mjs` owns the dashboard's metric catalog +
  pivot/pareto/leaderboard/coverage reshaping; `pg-store.mjs` is the read/write layer (all SQL
  runs through DuckDB's `postgres` extension, `$TIDY` → `pg.measurements`).
- **Config** — `config/models.yaml` (models, sampling, structured subject dims) and
  `config/hosts.yaml` (GPU host endpoints/SSH; set `SSH_HOST` if the alias doesn't resolve).

---

## 1. Running benchmarks

Prerequisites: Node ≥ 22, `npm install`, and a reachable GPU host configured in
`config/hosts.yaml` with the `llama.cpp` server scripts deployed (`npm run deploy`).

```bash
SSH_HOST=<ip> npm run bench -- --models Qwen3.6 --benches toolcalling,reasoning,triage \
    --think both --samples 1 --ctx 16384
```

The orchestrator writes each result straight to Postgres as it completes (plus a small run
manifest under `results/runs/<run_id>/`) and consults the capabilities cache to skip re-probing
context ceilings. Needs `LLMBENCH_DB_PASSWORD` in the env or `.env`. Flags: `--models <substr,…>`,
`--benches <name,…>`, `--think both|no_think|think`,
`--samples N` (multi-sample → per-metric mean + `spread`), `--ctx <n>`, `--target <host>`,
`--chat-template <path-on-host>` (A/B a custom template), `--keep-router` (don't stop the
host's systemd `llama-server` service).

Benches (`benches/`): `triage, reasoning, reasoning_hard, toolcalling, summarization,
docqa, coding_{multipl,hard,practical,bugfix}, agentic_loop, struct_output,
instruction_following`, plus **probes** (`benches/probes/`, self-manage the server):
`maxctx, kv_per_tok, throughput` (e2e/ttft), `speed, prefix_cache, quality_decay,
parallel_gen`.

> **Host note:** the GPU host runs a systemd `llama-server` model-router on port 8090.
> `bench-run` stops it for the run and restarts it after; it needs passwordless sudo on
> the host. Historical results are already in the store — `npm run backfill` re-imports
> any legacy `run.json`, `npm run caps-seed` re-seeds ceilings from it.

### Comparability

There's no separate "fingerprint" to reconcile any more: every measurement row carries
its own serving/platform dimensions (backend, kv_quant, flash_attn, batch/ubatch,
`llamacpp_build`, gpu, …). To compare like-for-like, filter on them; to see a config
difference, pivot on it. `llamacpp_build` (from `llama-server --version`) is captured per
run, so a silent llama.cpp upgrade shows up as a new value and invalidates the cached
context ceilings for that build.

---

## 2. Querying the store

Everything lands in the central Postgres table `llmbench.measurements` — analyse it any way you
like, no fixed "report" step. Query it through the app's engine (`$TIDY` expands to the table):

```bash
node -e "import('./analysis/pg-store.mjs').then(async m=>{
  const r = await m.query(\`SELECT chat_template,
      100.0*sum(metric_value) FILTER(WHERE metric='toolcall_pass')
           /sum(metric_value) FILTER(WHERE metric='toolcall_total') AS pct
    FROM \$TIDY WHERE bench='toolcalling' GROUP BY 1\`);
  console.table(r);})"
```

…or hit the DB directly (`docker exec central-db psql -U llmbench -d llmbench`), or use the
scorer (`analysis/score.mjs`) programmatically. The store never collapses configs: two runs that
differ in any measured dimension (template, quant, KV, build…) are distinct, queryable rows —
the thing the old `model|think|bench` merge couldn't do. (Scoring intentionally merges across
`llamacpp_build`, but the rows themselves keep the build for provenance.)

---

## 3. The dashboard

An **Observable Framework** app in `dashboard/` — a shared facet form driving four views:
**Leaderboard** (capability/speed/fleet, sortable), **Pareto** (quality vs throughput, bubble
size = VRAM), **Pivot** (A/B any two dims as a heatmap, with a Δ baseline), **Coverage** (run
vs not). The compute is the same pure `analysis/query-engine.mjs` + `score.mjs` the rest of the
suite uses (mirrored into `dashboard/src/lib/` at build time), so the dashboard can't drift
from the scoring.

**Data flow.** Benchmark runs write rows directly to the **central Postgres**
(`llmbench.measurements` on llm2). The dashboard's build-time data loader reads them through
DuckDB's `postgres` extension and bakes a static snapshot, so the published page needs no live
DB connection. No sync step — the store the run writes is the store the dashboard reads.

```bash
cp .env.example .env && edit .env         # set LLMBENCH_DB_PASSWORD (llmbench role password)
cd dashboard && npm ci && npm run dev      # local preview → http://localhost:3000
npm run build                              # static dist/ (what CI publishes)
```

Published to **<https://pages.xor0.de/llm-bench/>** (mobile-friendly). A push to `main` touching
`dashboard/` or `analysis/` — or a manual **Run workflow** after a data refresh — builds `dist/`
on the Forgejo runner and deploys it via the `pages` branch → Caddy. CI needs the
`LLMBENCH_DB_PASSWORD` Actions secret.

## 4. Deployment & running on a benchmarking host

**The matrix runs *on* the benchmarking host, from a git checkout — not from the dev box.**
Each benchmarking machine holds a checkout of this repo at `~/llm-bench` and runs `bench-run`
there; the dev box (where you edit) never drives the matrix. The single source of truth is the
Forgejo remote `origin` (`git.xor0.de/demonkoryu/llm-bench`); the Postgres store is central
(on llm2) and reachable from every host (needs `LLMBENCH_DB_PASSWORD`).

**Update loop (edit here → run there):**

```bash
# 1. On the dev box: edit, then commit + push to origin (Forgejo).
git commit -am "…" && git push origin main
# 2. Pull the change onto the benchmarking host (SSHes in, git pull --ff-only, chmods scripts).
scripts/deploy.sh --host <llm1|llm2>
# 3. Run the matrix ON that host, from the checkout; observe over SSH.
ssh <host> 'cd ~/llm-bench && node runners/bench-run.mjs --target <host> --benches … '
```

The two host types differ only in how inference is served:

- **llama.cpp hosts (rose / llm2).** `bench-run` owns the `llama-server` lifecycle and
  coexists with the host's systemd `llama-server` router. Run with `--local` (env
  `BENCH_LOCAL=1`) so the host scripts + router `systemctl` execute locally instead of over
  SSH. Readiness: `scripts/llm2/ready.sh`.
- **RapidMLX hosts (m1 / llm1).** RapidMLX is a **persistent daemon**, launched separately by
  [`scripts/llm1/serve.sh`](scripts/llm1/serve.sh) (installs via `brew install rapid-mlx`).
  For `engine: rapidmlx` the harness server-lifecycle is a **no-op** — it never starts/stops/
  reloads the daemon, has no VRAM readout, and talks to it over **loopback** (`127.0.0.1:8000`),
  so there is no `systemctl` and no SSH server-management (no `--local` needed). Launch (or
  relaunch — e.g. for the `--pflash always` A/B) the daemon with `serve.sh`, then run
  `bench-run --target m1` from the checkout. `serve.sh` also asserts the Metal wired-memory
  limit (`sysctl iogpu.wired_limit_mb`, set by the operator; it warns but never writes it).

## GPU host: building `llama.cpp` (ROCm + Vulkan)

The orchestrator drives a `llama.cpp` server on the GPU host over SSH; the host carries
**two** builds, switched with `run-suite --backend <vulkan|rocm>`. This section is the
source of truth for reproducing them (e.g. in Docker). Reference hardware: **AMD RX 7900
XT** (`gfx1100`, RDNA3, 20 GiB), Ubuntu 24.04, ROCm 7.2.3, Mesa/RADV 25.2. Tested against
llama.cpp `ggml-org/llama.cpp` @ commit **`a121232fd`**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp && cd llama.cpp
```

### ROCm build (`build-rocm/`)

```bash
export PATH=/opt/rocm/bin:$PATH
HIPCXX=/opt/rocm/bin/amdclang++ cmake -S . -B build-rocm \
  -DGGML_HIP=ON -DAMDGPU_TARGETS=gfx1100 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLAMA_CURL=ON
cmake --build build-rocm --config Release -j"$(nproc)" --target llama-server llama-bench llama-cli
```

For `gfx1100`, `-DGGML_HIP=ON` **auto-enables** the RDNA3 fast paths — you do not pass them
explicitly, but verify they landed in `build-rocm/CMakeCache.txt`:
`GGML_HIP_ROCWMMA_FATTN=ON` (WMMA flash-attention), `GGML_HIP_GRAPHS=ON`,
`GGML_HIP_MMQ_MFMA=ON` (native int8 MMQ). Runtime needs the **ROCm 7.x** stack.

### Vulkan build (`build-vulkan/`) — ⚠️ needs a modern `glslc`

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-vulkan \
  -DGGML_VULKAN=ON -DGGML_NATIVE=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DVulkan_GLSLC_EXECUTABLE=/opt/vulkan-sdk/x86_64/bin/glslc      # ← see below, do NOT omit
cmake --build build-vulkan -j"$(nproc)" --target llama-server llama-bench
```

**The `glslc` version is load-bearing for whether int-dot is even _available_.**
llama.cpp's int8 dot-product path is gated at _build time_ on a CMake feature-test that
tries to compile a `GL_EXT_integer_dot_product` shader. The **stock Ubuntu 24.04 `glslc`
(shaderc 2023.8 / glslang 14) cannot compile it**, so the macro
`GGML_VULKAN_INTEGER_DOT_GLSLC_SUPPORT` is silently left undefined and the int8 path is
compiled out — the device reports `int dot: 0`, with **no error**. Use a `glslc` from a
recent **Vulkan SDK ≥ 1.3.290** (we used LunarG **1.4.350.1** → shaderc v2026.2) to get
`int dot: 1`:

> **Measured caveat — int-dot is _off_ at runtime on this host.** Having `int dot: 1`
> available let us A/B it rigorously (runtime toggle `GGML_VK_DISABLE_INTEGER_DOT_PRODUCT`).
> On this RX 7900 XT + RADV + KHR_coopmat build it is **neutral-to-negative for decode**
> (0% … −7.4% tg; prefill unaffected) — it only swaps the decode GEMV kernel, and that
> kernel is slower than the coopmat path for our quants. So we **disable it at runtime**.
> Still build with the modern glslc (a different GPU/driver may flip the sign). Full data
>
> - the warmup-confound that earlier faked a "+37% win": [`results/int-dot-impact.md`](results/int-dot-impact.md).

```bash
VER=$(curl -s https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/latest/linux.txt)        # e.g. 1.4.350.1
curl -s -o sdk.tar.xz "https://sdk.lunarg.com/sdk/download/$VER/linux/vulkansdk-linux-x86_64-$VER.tar.xz"
mkdir -p /opt/vulkan-sdk && tar -xJf sdk.tar.xz -C /opt/vulkan-sdk --strip-components=1
# glslc is the prebuilt /opt/vulkan-sdk/x86_64/bin/glslc — point -DVulkan_GLSLC_EXECUTABLE at it
```

Runtime needs **Mesa/RADV ≥ 24.x** (exposes `VK_KHR_cooperative_matrix` and accelerated
integer dot for `gfx1100`). The build only needs the modern `glslc`; the Vulkan headers
and loader can stay at the distro version.

### Verify the build is optimal

A correct Vulkan build prints this device line on load (any `llama-bench`/server start):

```
ggml_vulkan: 0 = Radeon RX 7900 XT (RADV NAVI31) | fp16: 1 | int dot: 1 | matrix cores: KHR_coopmat
```

`int dot: 1` **and** `matrix cores: KHR_coopmat` must both be present — `int dot: 0` means
the glslc was too old (rebuild with a newer SDK). For ROCm, confirm
`GGML_HIP_ROCWMMA_FATTN=ON` in its CMakeCache.

### Server launch flags

The server is launched by [`scripts/llm2/start-server.sh`](scripts/llm2/start-server.sh):
`-fa on`, `--cache-type-k/v q8_0` (quantized KV), `--jinja`, `--reasoning-format auto`,
`-np 1`. Batch sizing (`-b 2048 -ub 2048`, the Vulkan prefill-throttle fix) is **not** in
the script — it is injected per-model from `config/models.yaml` `defaults.extra_flags`. See
that file's header for the rationale. For the **vulkan** backend the script also exports
`GGML_VK_DISABLE_INTEGER_DOT_PRODUCT=1` (int-dot measured net-negative for decode here —
override with `LLAMA_VK_INT_DOT=1`; see [`results/int-dot-impact.md`](results/int-dot-impact.md)).

## Scoring model (summary)

Defined in `shared/scoring.mjs` (pure module, shared by Node and the dashboard). Structure
is fixed in code; only the **dials** (weights/exponents) are adjustable in the UI.

- **Capability** (headline) = `coding × comprehension`.
  - **comprehension** (additive): triage/categorization, summarization, docqa, reasoning.
  - **coding** (multiplicative): hard gates `toolcalling × struct_output` × a competence
    bundle (coding grade, agentic loop, instruction following). A missing gate zeroes it.
  - Speed is **not** in capability — it informs the fleet score.
- **Fleet suitability** (geometric blend, ranks capable all-rounders that you can run many
  of):
  ```
  fleet = capability^w_cap × ctx_norm^w_ctx × slots_norm^w_slots × throughput^w_thru
  ```
  `w_cap=2` makes capability dominate; `ctx_norm` clamps main ctx at a 100k tier;
  `slots_norm` rewards how many 1-main-+-N-worker slots fit in VRAM (from measured KV/token
  - maxctx). `throughput^w_thru` is **off by default** (needs `parallel-gen`); raise the
    `w_thru` dial to weight measured aggregate tok/s.

`results/report.json` and the dashboard self-describe the formula via the `SCORING` export,
so the displayed formula can't drift from the code.
